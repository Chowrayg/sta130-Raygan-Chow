    "\n",
    "The key is when the sampling distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis is so extreme that no observed test statistic can be as extreme, it means that the hypothesis number is ridiculous e.g. if a coin is flipped and I hypothesize the sampling distribution to be 0.9 for heads, and the observed test statistic ranges from 0.4-0.6 for each sample, my hypothesis of 0.9 is clearly an outlier i.e. \"extreme\" compared to the actual data. Without even knowing what p-value means, I know that this result should show that my hypothesis is ridiculous. In terms of p-value, when the p-value is small, almost no observed statistic is as or more extreme than my hypothesis, so my hypothesis is ridiculous. Conversely, when the p-value is big, the observed statistic is as or more extreme than my hypothesis, which means that my hypothesis is really not that extreme because if so then most observed data is extreme i.e. evidence matches my hypothesis, so my hypothesis is not proven wrong."

    "Problem Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether students can identify the order in which milk is poured into tea. This experiment mirrors the classic experiment conducted by Fisher and Bristol, designed to test if a person could distinguish between tea prepared by pouring milk first versus tea prepared by pouring tea first.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original Fisher and Bristol experiment, Dr. Muriel Bristol claimed she could tell whether milk was added to tea or if tea was added to milk. Fisher designed an experiment to test her claim, ultimately using it to develop the statistical method known as Fisher's exact test. Similarly, in our experiment, we are testing whether students can identify the order in which milk is poured into tea, leveraging a hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this problem breakdown, I construct the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis as follows:\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): The students are guessing randomly and have a 50% chance of identifying the correct pouring order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The students are not guessing randomly and have a better-than-chance ability to identify the correct pouring order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis\n",
    "Methodology\n",
    "We conducted the experiment with 80 students, where 49 students correctly identified the pouring order. The statistical analysis involves calculating the sample proportion, standard error, Z-score, and p-value to determine if the results are statistically significant.\n",
